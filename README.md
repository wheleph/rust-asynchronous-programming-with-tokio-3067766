This repo contains source code for the course [Rust: Asynchronous Programming with Tokio](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rust-asynchronous-programming-with-tokio?dApp=59033956&leis=LAA).

My (wheleph) personal opinion about the course:

> If you want to get familiar with Tokio (Rust async runtime), it's better to look elsewhere.
> 
> The only "good" thing about the course for me was that to get through it, I needed to independently study Tokio docs and to experiment on my own. And learning in action is the best.
> 
> But that's probably not what most learners want.
